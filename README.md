# Python-Plot-Challenge

For this project I had to use several outside sources throughout the code that are documented below. In addition to the url for the site where I got the information I include a brief bullet point on how and where I used the code. 

1. https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-find-all-duplicate-rows-in-a-pandas-dataframe/#:~:text=To%20find%20duplicate%20rows%20in%20a%20pandas%20dataframe%2C%20we%20can,get%20all%20the%20duplicate%20rows.
  - I used this in line 3 with .loc to find the duplicated data in my DataFrame.

2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-delete-rows-columns-from-dataframe-using-pandas-drop/
  - I used this to assist with dropping mouse g989 from the Dataframe in line 5.

3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grouping-and-aggregating-with-pandas/
  - I used this in line 8 to assist with using the .agg function.

4. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-rotate-x-axis-tick-label-text-in-matplotlib/
  - I used this to assist with rotating the x labels in line 10.
